/**
 * Livewire view of the TSP dashboard.
 *
 * The legacy controller view required three round-trips to claim a
 * ticket: open modal → POST form → redirect to detail. This
 * component collapses that into a single click: `wire:click="claim"`
 * runs the Monday mutation, optimistically removes the ticket from
 * the Available list, optimistically adds it to My tickets, and
 * shows a success toast — all without a navigation.
 *
 * The non-JS POST route (`tsp.tickets.claim`) is kept as a fallback
 * so a customer with JS disabled can still claim. The route still
 * routes to TspDashboardController::claim().
 *
 * The list of "My tickets" carries the assigned TSP name (always
 * the current TSP after claim, but the customer side will use the
 * same resolver via the People column on Monday) so the row can
 * show "Assigned to: <name>" if the assignee differs from the
 * current viewer.

     * `status95` column text on every `loadLists()` run. The
     * categories mirror what the dashboard cards show so the
     * card numbers always agree with the row badges:
     *
     *   - `open`          → status contains "new" or "open"
     *   - `in_progress`   → status contains "progress"
     *   - `awaiting_parts`→ status contains "awaiting"
     *   - `resolved`      → status contains "resolved" / "closed"
     *                        / "done" / "complete" / "completed"
     *   - (anything else) → counts in `open` so we never drop
     *                       a ticket from the visible total
     *
     * Each ticket contributes to exactly one of `open`,
     * `in_progress`, `awaiting_parts`, or `resolved`, AND
     * always contributes to `total`. This keeps the card
     * numbers consistent with the row list — a previous
     * version of this code incremented both `open` and
     * `in_progress` for an in-progress ticket, which made
     * the cards look like they were double-counting.
     *
     * The pending_sync counter is split into two banner categories:
     *   - `pending_count`: rows still queued or in-flight (in
     *     `pending` / `syncing` state). These will go through
     *     automatically and only need a soft "queued" banner.
     *   - `error_count`: rows in `error` state. These need user
     *     attention (typically a permanently-broken source ticket
     *     on Monday, or invalid data). The "needs attention"
     *     banner surfaces them with retry / discard actions.
     *
     * `pending_sync` is kept for the soft "queued" callout (the
     * legacy single-banner UX) so other parts of the code that
     * read this key still work.
